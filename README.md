I-know-your-password
====================

Project about cracking passwords. In a most simple and easiest way and is very effective. 

Usage: python Passcracker.py [hashfile]

Settings are MD5 only, just edit when you want to crack other then MD5

======================++++++===================

The program will connect to twitter, grep a few tweets and use those words as basewords for cracking MD5 hashes. 
You can edit keywords.txt if you want to search for specific basewords. For example, when you did some research
on a person and you know the person loves soccer, cars, and gadgets. You can add to keywords.txt names of soccer clubs, 
his favorite cars, or when use an iphone you can add that too. Basically you can add everything you know about the person
to crack his password.
